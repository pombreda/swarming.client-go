Swarming.client (Go)
====================

This directory contains the client code to access the Swarming services.

The fact the service is implemented in Go or in python doesn't matter.

This code is only tested on Ubuntu.


Installation
------------

    go get -u github.com/maruel/swarming.client-go/swarming
    swarming

And use `swarming help <command>` for further help.
